# Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease
This is a machine learning project using BigML to analyze data to predict if someone will have heart disease. The dataset is from Kaggle, and the information is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and there are records of about 300 patients from Cleveland. The dataset contains 14 attributes that help determine whether a person has heart disease or not. There are 8 categorical and 6 numeric attributes. The attributes were age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, exercise induced angina, resting electrocardiographic results, and more. In my project, I prepared the data, developed an evaluation model with about 90% precision, 77% accuracy, and 76% recall. I developed a decision tree to show all the possible ways a heart prediction can be made. The attributes that contributing the most to heart disease are thal, cp, and ca.
